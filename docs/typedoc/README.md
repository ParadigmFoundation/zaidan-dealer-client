# Zaidan dealer client

A simple browser client for the Zaidan dealer system, leveraging 0x and ZEIP-18 based fills.

Includes helpful utilities for viewing ERC-20 balances, and setting 0x asset proxy allowances.

View [the documentation for full API reference.](./docs/classes/dealerclient.md)

## Usage

The `DealerClient` supports Web3 browsers that expose a `window.ethereum` provider, and can also be used in server environments by passing an Ethereum JSONRPC URL as the second parameter to the constructor.

In the future, it will support additional provider types, such as hardware wallets and mnemonics.

### Import into project
TypeScript/ES6:
```ts
import { DealerClient } from "@zaidan/dealer-client";
```

CommonJS:
```js
const { DealerClient } = require("@zaidan/dealer-client");
```

Browser (using provided WebPack config):
```js
const { DealerClient } = window.Zaidan;
```

### Initialize
Pass the `DealerClient` constructor a full URL to a Zaidan dealer RPC server.

## Client-side (browser)
```typescript
(async () => {
  const dealer = new DealerClient("https://dealer.zaidan.io/");

  // must be initialized before use, will prompt user to connect wallet
  await dealer.init();
})();
```

## Server-side (unlocked node)
```typescript
(async () => {
  const dealer = new DealerClient("https://dealer.zaidan.io/", "http://localhost:8545");

  // must be initialized before use, will prompt user to connect wallet
  await dealer.init();
})();
```

### Get and fill quotes
Request a price quote and fillable order from the dealer server:
```typescript
// other fields available in response (price, fee, etc.), see documentation
const { id, order } = await dealer.getQuote(4.24, "WETH/DAI", "bid");

// will prompt for signature and request the trade be settled by the dealer
const txId = await dealer.handleTrade(order, id);
```
